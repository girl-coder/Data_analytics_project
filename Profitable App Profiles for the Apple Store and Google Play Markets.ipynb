    "The project Profitable App Profile For the Apple Store and Google Play Markets has a goal of finding the apps which can create more revenue for the company. Result set will assist us in finding what type of apps are likely to attract more users.\n",
    "\n",
    "We only build apps that are free to download and install, and our main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means our revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users who use our app — the more users that see and engage with the ads, the better. Our goal for this project is to analyze data to help our developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users. To Do so, We will be analysing the data about number of google apps and apple store apps."

    "However, this niche seems to show some potential. One thing we could do is take another popular book and turn it into an app where we could add different features besides the raw version of the book. This might include daily quotes from the book, an audio version of the book, quizzes about the book, etc. On top of that, we could also embed a dictionary within the app, so users don't need to exit our app to look up words in an external app.\n",

    "* Food and drink — examples here include Starbucks, Dunkin' Donuts, McDonald's, etc. So making a popular food and                drink app requires actual cooking and a delivery service, which is outside the scope of our company.\n",
